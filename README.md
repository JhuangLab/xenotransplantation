### Abstract
Liver xenotransplantation is the most promising strategy to solve the global shortage of donor livers. Although recent pig-to-human heart, kidney, and auxiliary liver transplants have proven surgical feasibility, coagulation dysregulation remains the major obstacle to long-term survival.

Here we performed orthotopic liver xenotransplantation from our specific pathogen-free (SPF) **10-gene-edited** pig (GTKO/CMAHKO/β4GalNT2KO + hCD46/hCD55/hCD59/hTBM/hCD39/hEPCR/hCD47) into a Tibetan macaque. The graft showed immediate function (bile production within minutes) but the recipient rapidly developed severe consumptive coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia, fibrinogen depletion, PT/INR prolongation, and marked reduction of plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) within 24 h.

Using species-specific multi-omics (transcriptomics + DIA-PASEF proteomics) on pre- and 24 h post-reperfusion biopsies, we demonstrate:
- Dominant **recipient macrophage infiltration** and activation (phagosome, FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, ITGB1/ITGB5, PSMA2/PSMA5)
- Strong enrichment of **complement and coagulation cascades** in the xenograft
- Downregulation of porcine gluconeogenic enzymes indicating early metabolic compromise
- Absence of early T-cell involvement, but IgM deposition suggesting humoral contribution

These data reveal that, despite extensive genetic engineering, the principal early barriers in porcine-to-primate liver xenotransplantation are **macrophage-driven innate immunity** and **systemic coagulation exhaustion** via the complement–coagulation axis.

### Key Findings
| Barrier                     | Molecular Evidence                                  | Potential Targets                     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Consumptive coagulopathy   | vWF depletion, platelet/fibrinogen consumption, complement & coagulation cascade activation | vWF humanization, enhanced hTBM/EPCR/CD39 |
| Innate immune activation   | Macrophage phagocytosis, ITGB1/5 ↑, PSMA2/5 ↑       | Anti-ITGB1/5, proteasome modulation, stronger CD47-SIRPα tuning |
| Early metabolic stress     | PCK1, FBP1, GYS2 ↓                                  | Metabolic support strategies           |
